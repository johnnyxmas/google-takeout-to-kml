# Google Maps to KML Converter

Convert Google Maps saved places to KML format with advanced features.

## Features

- üó∫Ô∏è Convert CSV or ZIP exports to KML
- üìÅ Process multiple CSVs from ZIP archives
- üîç Reverse geocoding for location details
- üìù Detailed logging to file and console
- ‚ùå Track failed conversions with error reasons
- üìä Include failed locations in KML output

## How It Works

1. **Input Processing**:
   - Parses CSV files from Google Takeout or direct exports
   - Handles multiple formats (explicit coordinates or URL-embedded)
   - Processes ZIP archives containing multiple CSVs

2. **Data Conversion**:
   - Extracts coordinates from URLs or explicit columns
   - Validates coordinate ranges (-90 to 90 for lat, -180 to 180 for lon)
   - Performs reverse geocoding (when enabled) to get address details

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Tracks failed conversions with specific error reasons
   - Logs detailed error information to `google_maps_to_kml.log`
   - Includes failed locations in output KML under "Failed Conversions" folder

4. **Output Generation**:
   - Creates KML files with proper XML structure
   - Organizes successful locations by category
   - Preserves original URLs and names
   - Includes detailed error information for failed conversions

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Required packages:
  - requests
  - python-dateutil

## Usage

### Exporting from Google Takeout

1. Go to [Google Takeout](https://takeout.google.com)
2. Select only "Maps (your places)" data
3. Choose export format as CSV
4. Select delivery method (email/download)
5. Wait for Google to prepare your export
6. Download the ZIP archive containing your places

### Supported CSV Formats

The script supports:
1. CSV with explicit Latitude/Longitude columns
2. Google Takeout format with coordinates in URLs

Column names can vary (case-insensitive):
- Name/Title
- URL/Google Maps URL
- Latitude/lat
- Longitude/lon/lng

### Basic Conversion

```bash
python3 google_maps_to_kml.py input.csv output.kml
```

### ZIP Archive Processing

```bash
# Creates multiple KMLs in output_directory/
python3 google_maps_to_kml.py takeout.zip output_directory/
```

### With Reverse Geocoding

```bash
python3 google_maps_to_kml.py --geocode input.csv output.kml
```

### Debug Mode

```bash
# Enables detailed logging
python3 google_maps_to_kml.py --debug input.csv output.kml
```

## Output Format

For ZIP inputs:

```
output_directory/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Saved Places.kml
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Starred Places.kml
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

Each KML contains:

- Place names
- Coordinates
- Original URLs
- Location details (with --geocode)
- Categorized placemarks
- Failed conversions section (with error details)

## Error Handling

The tool will:

- Skip malformed rows with warnings
- Continue after API errors
- Provide clear error messages
- Track failed conversions with reasons
- Log detailed information to `google_maps_to_kml.log`
- Exit with status codes:
  - 0: Success
  - 1: Fatal error
  - 2: Partial success

## Configuration

The following settings can be modified by editing the script directly:

- `GEOCODE_URL`: Nominatim reverse geocoding endpoint (default: "https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/reverse")
- `USER_AGENT`: User agent string for API requests (default: "GoogleMapsToKML/1.0")
- `MAX_RETRIES`: Number of retry attempts for geocoding (default: 3)
- `CACHE_SIZE`: Size of geocoding cache (default: 1000)

## Examples

Process a full Google Takeout:

```bash
python3 google_maps_to_kml.py --geocode takeout-2025-05-11.zip my_places/
```

Convert single CSV with details:

```bash
python3 google_maps_to_kml.py --geocode saved_places.csv map.kml
```

Debug mode with detailed logging:

```bash
python3 google_maps_to_kml.py --debug test.csv output.kml
